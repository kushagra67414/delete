## Google Cloud Platform Fundamentals: Core Infrastructure

## What is Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is a way of using I.T. that has these five equally important traits. First,
you get computing resources on-demand and self-service. 
All you have to do is use a simple interface and you get the processing power, storage, and network you need, with no need for human intervention. 
Second, you access these resources over the net from anywhere you want. 
Third, the provider of those resources has a big pool of them and allocates them to customers out of that pool. 
That allows the provider to get economies of scale by buying in bulk and pass the savings on to the customers. Customers don't have to know or care about the exact physical location of those resources. Fourth, the resources are elastic.
If you need more resources you can get more, rapidly. If you need less, you can scale back. And last, the customers pay only for what they use or reserve as they go.If they stop using resources, they stop paying. That's it. That's the definition of cloud.


## GCP computing architectures

According to some estimates out there publicly, Google's network carries as much as 40 percent of the world's Internet traffic every day. 
Google's network is the largest of its kind on earth and the company has invested billions of dollars over the years to build it. 
It's designed to give its users the highest possible throughput and the lowest possible latencies for their applications. 
The network interconnects at more than 90 Internet exchanges and more than 100 points of presence worldwide. 
When an Internet user sends traffic to a Google resource, Google responds to the user's request from an edge network location that will provide the lowest latency. Google's Edge-caching network sites content close to end users to minimize latency.
